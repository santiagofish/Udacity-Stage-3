# Udacity-Stage-3
Project for Stage 3 of Udacity Intro to Programming

These python files, created for Stage 3 of Udacity's Intro to Programming nanodegree, constitute a dynamic way to create a web page for displaying the user's favorite films. The page will also display other relevant information: storyline description, poster art, etc., which can be modified by the user within entertainment_center.py.

The functionality is very simple but user data is handled dynamically.
